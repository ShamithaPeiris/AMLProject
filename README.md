🥦 Market Price Forecasting System
THis project is a Machine Learning solution designed to predict the weekly market prices of vegetables and fruits in Sri Lanka. It combines historical price data with climate indicators (Rainfall, Temperature) to provide actionable insights for farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

🚀 Key Features

🔮 Price Forecasting: Predict future prices (LKR/kg) based on Region, Season (Month), and Weather conditions.

🧠 Explainable AI (XAI): Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to reveal why the model predicts a specific price (e.g., "High Rainfall = Price Spike").

⛈️ Climate-Market Correlation: Dual-axis charts visualizing the direct impact of weather patterns on food prices.

📉 Volatility Analysis: Bollinger Bands and Radar Charts to identify market stability and regional disparities.

🕸️ Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit.

🛠️ Tech Stack
  
  Language: Python
  
  Machine Learning: CatBoost Regressor (Gradient Boosting on Decision Trees)
  
  Explainability: SHAP (Shapley Values)
  
  Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
  Web Framework: Streamlit
